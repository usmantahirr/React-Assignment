PS: I did this assignment over a year ago. I had clear directions what to do. There was a part of basic code written down already.

I made it look nice and added the requirements given to be by the company.

# TimeChimp React Coding Challenge ðŸŽ§

## Setup ðŸš€

- Install all dependencies using `npm install`
- Run the app using `npm start`

## Assessment ðŸ“–

Use the Spotify API to fetch and display the following items:

- Fetch and display _Released This Week_ songs
  - Use the API path `new-releases`
- Fetch and display _Featured Playlists_
  - Use the API path `featured-playlists`
- Fetch and display _Browse_ genres
  - Use the API path `categories`
- Loading state/UI _(optional, current UX is already clean)_

## Think about ðŸ’¡

- Taking a look at the Spotify API documentation
- Do you resolve each API request one after the other or in parallel?
- Where do you make the API requests?
- Do you implement state management using something like Redux?
- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?

We don't want to restrict you too much so feel free to scope the project to your time and needs (usually it takes around 1-2 hours).
However; make sure there is enough code (written by yourself) to explain your design and approach.

_Be creative, be awesome!_
